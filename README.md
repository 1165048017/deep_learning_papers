# deep learning papers

This is a collection of papers on "deep learning" related to computational biology.
The point of this repository is to get papers that others think are important or translate well to problems in computational biology.
I hope to pick a subset of these for our "deep learning for comp bio" reading group in Spring 2016.

In particular, my interests lie in:

- dimension reduction techniques
- clustering techniques
- functional annotation
- other things that I probably don't know about that are cool
